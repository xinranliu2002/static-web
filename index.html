                </div>

                <p> I’m a film enthusiast currently pursuing a B.A. in Mathematics at Reed College, located in the mystic city of Portland, Oregon.
                    Tracing back my footsteps, my journey starts at Beijing, China, where I spent my childhood and teenage years with my family.</p>
                <p> During my undergraduate studies, I've had the opportunity to collaborate with the most wonder people, conducting research in quantum computation, cryptography, and trade dynamics.
                    I'm currently studying the anti-concentration property of quantum random circuit sampling for my year-long thesis project.
                </p>
                <p>I've also focused on building my applied skills in programming. With a wealth of experience in data-centric areas,
                    I'm interested in the potential to enhance research narrative and extract insights through data analysis and visualizations.</p>
                <p>I am also a member of the Big Mouth Society, a local musician community at Portland and freelance photographer. 
                    I love creating art through collaborative relationships, as I ambition to explore the world and people to their fullest extent.</p>
